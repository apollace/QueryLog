QueryLog is a log parser designed to find what you are looking for. QueryLog is designed to search in your log folder open one file at a time following the alphabetical order. QueryLog can either find all rows inside your file that match with a specific set of words or use specific built-in functions set. QueryLog has two kind of built-in functions:

  * Single-line functions;
  * Multi-line functions;

A single-line function is a function that works considering only one line at a time, a multi-line function is a function that can perform complex queries that involve more than one line at a time. Let me do an example if you want to find a user request that starts with a handshake, continue with a set of operation used to build the output and at the end see the output generated you can do that.
