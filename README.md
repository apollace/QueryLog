Welcome to the QueryLog wiki!

QweryLog is the simplest way to found what you are looking for in your application log. It can follow request across multiple threads, follow multiple requests belonging to a single user and a lot of other stuff.

QweryLog uses its own query syntax. It has nothing in common with DB query syntax but it is powerful enough to found what you are searching.
